# Programming Elixir - GitHub Issues

Working through chapter 13 of Programming Elixir.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add pe_issues to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:pe_issues, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure pe_issues is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:pe_issues]]
        end
